# Token System

HALL 1000 uses rich mathematical tokens to represent different modalities:

- **Mathematical Tokens**: For symbolic, geometric, numerical, and abstract reasoning.
- **Linguistic Tokens**: For language processing.
- **Visual Tokens**: For image and video data.
- **Embodied Tokens**: For physical dynamics and control.

These tokens are processed by the multi-hemispheric architecture and integrated by the universal coherence operator.
