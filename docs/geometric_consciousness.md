# Geometric Consciousness Framework

The Geometric Consciousness Framework is based on the Fractal Density Activation Axiom (FDAA) which states that coherent neural dynamics converge to a specific temporal fractal dimension:

\[ D_t \approx 0.81 \]

This invariant emerges from first principles and has been empirically validated across biological and artificial systems.

## Multi-Hemispheric Architecture

The architecture consists of:

- **Left Hemisphere**: Unified temporal stream for coherence.
- **Right Hemispheres**: Multiple specialized perpendicular streams for different modalities.

## Universal Coherence Operator

The universal coherence operator $U$ ensures that all processing streams remain in the Still-Fish equilibrium ($D_t \approx 0.81$).
