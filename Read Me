# HALL 1000: Multi-Hemispheric AGI Core

HALL 1000 is a geometric consciousness framework for artificial general intelligence, based on the Fractal Density Activation Axiom (FDAA) and multi-hemispheric architecture.

## Features

- **Geometric Consciousness**: Implements the FDAA framework for coherent intelligence.
- **Multi-Hemispheric Design**: Unified temporal stream with multiple specialized perpendicular streams.
- **Embodied Intelligence**: Rich mathematical tokens for physical dynamics, control theory, and sensorimotor integration.
- **Scalable Architecture**: From simple transformers to large-scale AGI systems.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/HALL-1000.git
   cd HALL-1000
